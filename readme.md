Some actual coding form a recent tech challenge.

question4.js

4. Write a program that prints the day of the week given a number of days and weeks. Answer
the following questions.
Example: 30 days from Monday is Wednesday.
Hint: The function definition should take 2 arguments: “days” and “weeks”
getDay(days, weeks) { return days }
4a. Today is Sunday - What day of the week will it be in 100 days?
4b. Today is Tuesday - What day of the week will it be in 4 weeks and 2 days?
4c. Today is Friday - What day of the week will it be in 294 days?

I respectfully think that this question can be asked in a more clear manner.
My code actually accepts three arguments, the day in which you're starting from
the number of days and weeks into the future.

This may be run by running "node question4.js" from the CLI.

question4d.js

4d. Bonus: What month and day is it 73 days after October 31st 2018?

I respectfully think that this question should ask what month, day and year
is it 73 days after October 31st, 2018?
